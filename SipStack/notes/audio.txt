Java Sound API

Though apparently JMF supports RTP but Java Sound doesn't. See
http://www.jsresources.org/faq_general.html

This resource:

suggests using Java Sound in conjunction with the RTP implementation in JMF.


Someone (https://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=1271001) said this:
For my project, I initially considered JMF...but ran into issues due to the level of abstraction it provides. With JMF, I was able to play audio easily but to actually do anything else with it was almost impossible or very difficult given the provided interfaces. And judging from the last release, I don't think Sun is actively supporting it.

My project plays live streaming audio over RTP using Java Sound. There is a Java library that implements the RTP protocol called jrtp which can be found at https://jrtp.dev.java.net.
